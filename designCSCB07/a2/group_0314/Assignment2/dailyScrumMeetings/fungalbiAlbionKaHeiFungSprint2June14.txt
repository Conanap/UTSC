What did I do last time:
	- Made revisions (a lot, rewrote couple of times due to inconsistent decision on implementation) to JShell
	- Completed Input.class
	- Completed Cat.class
	- Began implementing a file system in JShell

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete manual for Cat and exit
	- Complete file sys implementation
	- Recomplete Echo (2 implementation changes, required to start from scratch)
	- Update crc cards to reflect current design
	- Work on things possible for Sprint 3 when all above complete (push and pop d)

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Waiting on Directory.class to implement proper file navigation so I can test Cat
	- Waiting on completion of other commands to implement properly within JShell

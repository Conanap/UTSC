What did I do last time:
	- Wrote Overwrite.class
	- Wrote Append.class
	- Created base of Redirect.class
	- Helped modify Directory.class to put files and directories rather than new ones(A Violation).
	- Documented commands with JDoc.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete Redirect.class with respect to Directory system.
	- Ensure Jdoc documentation standard is agreed upon, and that mine matches said standard.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Until I communicate with group and completely understand how the Directory system works, Redirect.class cannot be completed.
	- Finishing JDoc command is 'impossible' until a standard is agreed upon by everyone.

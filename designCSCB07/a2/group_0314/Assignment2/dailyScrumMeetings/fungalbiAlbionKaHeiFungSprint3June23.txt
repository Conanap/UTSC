What did I do?
	- Moved out runcmd to it's own class
	- Fixed a bug where if you don't type anything before pressing entre in the JShell, it would cause a crash
	- Show proper error messages for mkdir (eg file already exists)
	- Fixed a bug where runcmd causes improper file allocation
	- Fixed a bug that allowed you to cd to a file
	- Fixed a bug in popd which makes you can't pop any directory
	- Added edge case catching for push and pop
	- Fixed Cat.java such that it is more inline with conventions

What do I plan to do?
	- Keep debugging
	- Make some more test cases (if needed)

Blocked?
	- Nop.

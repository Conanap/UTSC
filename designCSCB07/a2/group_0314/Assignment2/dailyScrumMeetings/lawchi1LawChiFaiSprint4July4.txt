What did I do last time:
	- Written Mv Class (Not fully complete, see blocked on)
	- Fixed outputs from System.out.print to either stdin or stderr
	- (Barely) Helped with getting redirect classes working

What do I plan to do now?
	- Continue to update class outputs to stdin or stderr
	- Assist in any other things that other group members may need help with
	- Start doing CRC cards, as no one was assigned to do them but we will need them for both concept and final product.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Mv class implementation requires rm to be properly implemented, which is not as of this date.

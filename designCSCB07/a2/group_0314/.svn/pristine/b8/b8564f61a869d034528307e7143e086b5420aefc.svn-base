What did I do?
	- Finish test cases for all classes I wrote (echo, cat, mkdir, filesystem, Input, dirstack, pop and pushd)
	- Note: JShell and RunCmd do not have test cases as if the commands (and above classes) work correctly, they will.
	- Finished up commenting and javadocs

What will I do?
	- Hand in everything and cry as I fail my exam tomorrow

Am I blocked on anything?
	- My arteries are blocked. Jk, nothing.

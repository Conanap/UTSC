What did I do last time?
- created JShell code to parse inputted commands
- brainstormed ideas with group to implement file system
What do I plan to do now?
- create File and Directory CRC cards
- finalize API for command classes
Am I blocked on anything?
- Need command class APIs to be finalized before JShell can call them

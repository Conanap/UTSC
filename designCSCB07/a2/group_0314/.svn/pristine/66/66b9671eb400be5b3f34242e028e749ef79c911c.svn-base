What did I do last time:
	- Implemented Redirect.class (poorly, fixed by Albion, thanks bro)
	- Fixed a few minor bugs in Redirect.class as well.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Create documentation for Man
	- Help test and debug the program on different interactions

Am I blocked on anything?
	- None as of writing.

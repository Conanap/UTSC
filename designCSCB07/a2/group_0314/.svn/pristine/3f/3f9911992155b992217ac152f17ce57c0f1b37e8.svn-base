What did I do last time:
	- Completed base code for JShell such that it can take commands and recognize commands
	- Enabled JShell to output if and only if the command returns output
	- Completed crcCards in collaboration with everyone else in the groups

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start and finish the next sprint backlog before the next sprint starts
	- Start on commands if time permits
	- Figure out how to get main function to run on anything besides bluej

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Waiting on file systems completion

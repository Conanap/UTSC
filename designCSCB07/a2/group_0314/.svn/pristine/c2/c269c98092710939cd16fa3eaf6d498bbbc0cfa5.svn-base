What did I do last time:
	- Finished Base Code for Files
	- Made revision changes to Files after discussion with group members

What do I plan to do now?
	- Writing the Overwrite.class
	- Writing the Append.class
	- Document commands to this point.
	- Writing Redirect.class?

Am I blocked on anything?
	- In order to test these classes properly, in their intended environment, the Shell must be implemented.
	- As Redirect.class is necessary for both classes that I am writing, I will probably write it also.
	- DirMgt.class is also above Redirect.class, and its implementation is paramount to how Redirect works.

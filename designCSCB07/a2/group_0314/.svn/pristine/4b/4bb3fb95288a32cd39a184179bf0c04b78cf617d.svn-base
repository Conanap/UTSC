What did I do last time:
	- Updated Javadoc once more to match Standard of team
	- Added additional comments and Javadoc to clarify program parts.
	- Test cases

What do I plan to do now?
	- Test cases

Am I blocked on anything?
	- test case for Cat 'ambiguous', not sure if an entirely new Mock FS + Mock Directory is needed to test command properly.

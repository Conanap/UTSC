What did I do?
	- a bunch of bug fixes (generally typos and due to new implementation)
	- Import statements for all files
	- Some optimization in a few command classes
	- Rewrote a few classes to properly utilize the new implementation
	- Changed command to a abstract class
	- updated all except append, redirect and overwrite to reflect above change
	- Completed file / dir not found exception
	- implemented exceptions above into cd (partly), cat, cp, mkdir, popd, pushd, !

To do:
	- unit test
	- docs
	- bug fix moar
	- testing, optimization

Blocked:
	- redirect, append, overwrite

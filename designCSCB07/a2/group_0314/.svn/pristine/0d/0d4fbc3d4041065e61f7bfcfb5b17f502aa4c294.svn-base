What did I do last time:
	- Completed Curl class
	- Ported Curl class over to implement Command
	- Assisted in porting several other classes over to implement Command

What do I plan to do now?
	- Port Redirects over to Command (Template done on local drive, awaiting clarification, see "blocked")
	- If nothing else, CRC cards.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Somewhat confused over Redirect implementation in RunCommand, awaiting clarification atm
